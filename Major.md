## 4.3 Testing Techniques and Test Plans

- Unit testing for components and functions
- Integration testing for API endpoints
- User acceptance testing

A robust testing strategy is implemented to ensure the reliability and correctness of the platform. Unit tests are written for individual components and utility functions, validating their behavior in isolation. Integration tests are conducted for API endpoints and database interactions, verifying that different parts of the system work together as intended. User acceptance testing (UAT) involves real users interacting with the platform to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations. Automated testing frameworks (such as Jest and React Testing Library) are used to streamline the testing process and enable continuous integration (CI/CD). Test cases are documented and regularly updated to reflect changes in the codebase, and test coverage is monitored to identify areas for improvement.

### Example Test Scripts for Endpoint Testing

The following is a sample test script for endpoint testing using Jest and Supertest in a Next.js/Node.js environment. These scripts ensure that API endpoints respond correctly to various requests and handle edge cases appropriately.

```javascript
// __tests__/api/parse-resume.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../../app'); // Adjust path if using custom server, else use Next.js handler

describe('POST /api/parse-resume', () => {
  it('should parse a valid resume file and return extracted data', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/api/parse-resume')
      .attach('resume', '__tests__/fixtures/sample_resume.pdf');
    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(res.body).toHaveProperty('extractedData');
  });

  it('should return 400 for missing file', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/api/parse-resume');
    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(400);
    expect(res.body).toHaveProperty('error');
  });
});
```

> Note: Adjust the import and app/server handler as per your project setup. For Next.js API routes, you may use `next-test-api-route-handler` or similar utilities.

These endpoint tests can be extended to cover authentication, authorization, and error handling for all RESTful or serverless API routes in the platform.

### Testing Endpoints from the Console

You can also test API endpoints directly from your console or terminal using tools like `curl` or [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/). This is useful for quickly verifying endpoint behavior without writing scripts. Here are some example commands:

**Using curl:**

```sh
# Test a POST endpoint with a file upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/parse-resume -F "resume=@/path/to/sample_resume.pdf"

# Test a GET endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/some-endpoint

# Test a POST endpoint with JSON data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/interview -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"role": "Frontend Developer", "experience": 3}'

# Test a PUT endpoint
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/interview/123 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"status": "completed"}'

# Test a DELETE endpoint
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/interview/123

# Test an endpoint with custom headers (e.g., for authentication)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" http://localhost:3000/api/protected-endpoint
```

**Using HTTPie:**

```sh
# Test a POST endpoint with a file upload
http -f POST http://localhost:3000/api/parse-resume resume@/path/to/sample_resume.pdf

# Test a GET endpoint
http GET http://localhost:3000/api/some-endpoint

# Test a POST endpoint with JSON data
http POST http://localhost:3000/api/interview role="Frontend Developer" experience:=3

# Test a PUT endpoint
http PUT http://localhost:3000/api/interview/123 status="completed"

# Test a DELETE endpoint
http DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/interview/123

# Test an endpoint with custom headers (e.g., for authentication)
http GET http://localhost:3000/api/protected-endpoint "Authorization:Bearer <your_token>"
```

These commands allow you to:

- Upload files
